# BookGraphQL
A first small application to test GraphQL and Apollo - Build with React and Express


The "client" contains the React application which can be started with the command:
- yarn
- yarn start

The "server" contains the Express application which can be started with the command:
- npm install
- npm run dev

Inside the "server", you can add your database in the "app.js" file by replacing `PLACE_HERE_YOUR_MONGO_DB` with your MongoDB URI.
